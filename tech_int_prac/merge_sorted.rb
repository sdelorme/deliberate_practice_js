# Given two sorted arrays, merge the second array into the first array while ensuring that the first array remains sorted. Do not use any built-in sort methods.

# Input :
# A : [1, 5, 8]
# B : [6, 9]

# Modified A : [1, 5, 6, 8, 9]

# function that takes in two strings
# declare two pointers/iterators
# starting with first index of each array conditional to see if b is greater than a
# if not, check the second value in a...if it is, then insert value into and move on to the next index of the second array
